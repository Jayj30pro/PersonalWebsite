                        <p>Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively.
You can learn to use Python and see almost immediate gains in productivity and lower maintenance costs.</p>
                        <p>Python is used successfully in thousands of real-world business applications around the world, including many large and mission critical systems. Here are some quotes from happy Python users:</p>

                        <p>Python is available on all three major computer platforms</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Windows</li>
                            <li>Mac</li>
                            <li>Linux</li>
                        </ol>
                    </article>
            </section>

                        <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.</p>
                        <p>Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.

                        <p>When getting started with any programming language simple commands like printing items on the screen and basic math are go-to operations. </p>
                        <p>most people start with hello world</p>
                        <p>Here is an example<code>print("Hello World!")</code></p>
                        <p>Most math will start with some form of<code>x=3 y=4 z=x+y</code></p>
                        <p>One of the more intermediate techniques in python iS the if statement<code> if x>5: </code>if statements can be used to bring logic and control to a program by specifying conditions when to act.</p>

                        <p>Python has many uses and practical applications. One of the most powerful features of python is the libraries available to the language. A simple command like <code> import pandas</code>and an entire set of tools is now available for high level data analysis. </p>

                        <p>Python also has libraries that can help with artificial intelligence. A command like<code>import tensorflow as tf</code>is a great place to start experimenting with A.I.</p>
